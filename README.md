### Tubing Failure Prediction Model - Auto Retrain, Comparision and Update with Existing Published Model
####  [Databricks - Tubing Failure Classification Prediction Model](https://github.com/dzheng616/data_is_the_new_oil/blob/61b48bb9b1108491578146c883525540afaacd5d/Python/Databricks-Classification%20Prediction%20(XGboost).ipynb)
######  (Data Import and Preparation, Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Interpretaion and Economic Value Calculation...)

######  In this project, the goal is to re-train a model for predicting tubing failures and set up automatic process for further model update. To do so, the following analysis were performed:
####### 1. Load data and features from Azure Data Warehouseto Databricks
####### 2. Data prepared for modeling and separated into training, testing and validation dataset. Sampling steps are taken to address data distribution. 
####### 3. Grid search and cross validation are applied to XGboost model for optimization. XGboost is chosen from many iteration test (Random Forest, XGBoost, GBM, Logistic Regression and etc.) 
####### 4. Model results and feature importance are interpreted for validation. 
####### 5. Business values are calculated based on communication with end users. Threshold sweep is performed to optimized business value. 
####### 6. Compare business value generated with outdated model and automatically update to outperforming model. 
####### 7. Results communicated to customer with business value and recommendation dashboard.
