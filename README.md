### Tubing Failure Prediction Model - Auto Retrain, Comparision and Update with Existing Published Model
####  [Databricks - Tubing Failure Classification Prediction Model](https://github.com/dzheng616/data_is_the_new_oil/blob/61b48bb9b1108491578146c883525540afaacd5d/Python/Databricks-Classification%20Prediction%20(XGboost).ipynb)
######  (Data Import and Preparation, Grid Search and Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Interpretaion and Economic Value Calculation...)

######  In this project, the customer has an outdated random forest model for predicting tubing failure at a daily level. The goal is to re-train a model for predicting failures and set up automatic process for further model update.
